# CMS ICD Diagnosis/Procedure Codes and Descriptions

### Overview
  * Contains CMS releases for ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes, for CMS fiscal years (FYs) 2010-2020, as the codes and their long and short descriptions. 
  * Probably self-explanatory, but diagnosis codes are in [ICD_Diag_Desc](/ICD_Diag_Desc) and loaded via the ICD_Diag_001_Import_Descriptions... stored procedure and procedures codes are in [ICD_Proc_Desc](/ICD_Proc_Desc) and loaded via ICD_Proc_001_Import_Descriptions... .

### Files Available Here
  * **Note**: The file specification for the ICD-10 order files allows the Code_Desc_Long field to be up to 323 characters, but the max observed length in ICD-9 and ICD-10 files is never longer than 228 (diagnoses) or 163 (procedures). 
  * Both diagnosis and procedure codes have the same file layout, but those layouts are different for ICD-9 vs. -10, as follows:
      - **ICD-9**: One file for each FY and code type, bar-delimited format, containing ICD codes and short and long descriptions, with double-quotes surrounding every field. This file specification double-escapes any double-quotes within the descriptions, so the INSERT statement in the OPENROWSET SPs cleans them out again with a REPLACE() function.
      - **ICD-10**: One file for each FY and code type, fixed-width format, containing ICD codes and short and long descriptions. These were downloaded directly from cms.gov. The fixed-width format means that no delimiters exist. The .fmt file has placeholders (Filler_##) to account for them.
  * The flat files with the ICD-9 code descriptions available here are reformatted versions of the files I downloaded directly from CMS, after saving the .xls or .xlsx code-descriptions file as bar-delimited flat file, with double-quote text qualifiers around all fields. The source is Excel files because of the variations in what was available in the ICD-9 releases as the flat (non-Excel) files. For example, the flat files:
      - Did not have a single, common file structure: FY 2010 contained one flat file with both long and short descriptions; all others contained a separate short-description file and long-description file.
      - FY 2010 was also the only release where the flat file was not space-delimited. Instead it was .csv/comma-delimited AND used double-quotes as text-qualifiers, but only around descriptions that contained commas (and other special characters?). Naturally, SQL Server does not recognize the unofficial/de facto standard for .csv files (e.g., RFC 4180).
      - The flat files for the release did not always contain any post-release corrections to the long descriptions (e.g., diagnosis code 86415 for CMS FY 2010 and 2012; diagnosis code 55011 for CMS FY 2013). Moreover, the FY 2010 release contained a flat file with the corrections, but the ICD diagnosis codes in it lacked any leading zeros (e.g., the first two diagnosis codes are "10" and "11" instead of "0010" and "0011", which would require rather tricky special handling to import and map back to what the values should be.
