# CMS MCE Simple ICD Code Edits

### Overview
  * This is derived from the documentation for the MS (Medicare Severity) DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) Grouper software with Medicare Code Editor ([MCE](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/MS-DRG-Classifications-and-Software.html)).  
  * This repo contains the "simple" diagnosis and procedure code edits from the Medicare Code Editor documentation, for CMS fiscal years (FYs) 2010-2020 (MCE versions 27-37, MCE skipped version 28 to re-align with the CMS release versions for ICD codes).
  * The flat files within this directory are read in via one of the ICD_MCE_001_Import_Simple_Code_Edits... stored procedures.
  
### Files Available Here
  * This repo converts portions of the CMS documentation (typically PDF for ICD-9, and .txt for ICD-10) into delimited flat files, with the goal of providing reference tables that will aid in returning usable output from batch calls to the MCE software. It will be useful within a SQL-based data mart containing final (i.e., after claims have been submitted) facility medical claims that lack DRGs or where the DRGs are unreliable. Per the "Medicare Severity Grouper with Medicare Code Editor Software"'s installation and user's manual (software version 35, October 2017), the MCE software is intended for "evaluation of patient data to help identify possible errors in coding".
  * MCE_Simple_Code_Edits...txt files within this directory were created as follows: 
      - CMS FY 2017-2020: Created these files from the lists in each of the labeled sections (i.e., MCE_Section and MCE_Edit_Type fields) of the "Definition of Medicare Code Edits v##" documentation, which CMS provides as a .txt file. 
      - CMS FY 2010 - 2016: No .txt version of that documentation was available, so I saved the PDF as text. It is possible that the code descriptions have typos introduced by OCR text recognition, but I compared what I generated here to files that were generated by working backwards from the FY 2015 file, applying the code changes in each version's "Code List Changes" chapter. I've checked, and the only differences that I've found accurately reflect the MCE documentation (e.g., ICD procedures 5280 and 5569 for FY 2010).
  
### "Simple" Code Edits: What that Means
  * This repo only includes the MCE sections that list specific ICD diagnosis or procedure codes. That means that **Section 1** (Invalid diagnosis or procedure code), **Section 2** (External causes of morbidity codes as principal diagnosis), and **Section 3** (Duplicate of PDX) are not lists that can be provided here, but that logic should be applied elsewhere.
  * This includes only "simple" diagnosis and procedure code edits, that is it excludes:
      -  Sections from the MCE Code Edits where (a) a procedure code is non-covered or considered a questionable admissions, except when combined with a certain set of diagnosis codes (e.g., **Sections 8.B, 11.B and 11.C**), (b) a procedure code is non-covered only when a certain set of diagnosis codes are present or absent (e.g., **Sections 11.C to 11.E**), or (c) a procedure code has limited coverage when combined with a particular diagnosis code (**Section 17.B**). 
      -  The specific **Section 9** diagnosis codes that are unacceptable as a principal diagnosis unless a secondary diagnosis code is provided (e.g., ICD-9 "V571" and ICD-10 "Z5189"). 
      -  ICD-9 **Section 12** (Open biopsy check), because it was only in effect for CMS FY 2010
      -  ICD-9 **Section 13** (Bilateral procedure), because I am working with claims that have already been submitted.

### CMS MCE Code Edits: Data Dictionary and Summary Counts
#### Data Dictionary for CMS MCE Code Edits in this Repo
  * **ICD_Code_Type**: Valid Values: P (ICD surgical procedure code) or D (ICD diagnosis code)
  * **ICD_Desc**: The code description provided in the MCE documentation. This is the "short" description
  * **MCE_Section** and **MCE_Subsection**: Within chapter 1 of the MCE documentation, the section and subsection where these codes are listed (if subsections do not exist, that is represented with "\_") ). There is a one-to-one match between these two fields and the MCE_Edit_Type combined with the ICD_Code_Type.
  * **MCE_Edit_Type**: Short, standardized value that references the label in the MCE documentation. See the [Mapping MCE Fields](#mapping-mce-fields-to-labels-in-mce-documentation) section for all valid values
